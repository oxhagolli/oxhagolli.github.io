                <div>
                    <p>Have you ever had so many things to do that at some point that you think "What do I do first"? That is exactly the problem that a few friends and I tried to solve at HackBU (Binghamton University). Basically, you can create your own prioritized schedule and tell our program when you're free and when do you need to do everything by and we sort out your schedule so that you can get everything done in time and without worrying about what to do first. This project won third prize at the hackathon. I worked mainly on the backend. Languages &amp; frameworks: <b>Python, Django, HTML, CSS</b></p>
                </div>
                <h3>Alpha Pill Pal</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>My team and I created a web service that helps patients and their doctors set text reminders to take their medicine when needed. This service allows the prescriber to set the reminder without the user having to do anything. We use the <b>twilio API</b> to send texts. This project won the Best Health Hack prize at UBHacking (University at Buffalo). I worked primarly on the backend. Languages &amp; frameworks: <b>Python, Django, Twilio, HTML, CSS</b></p>
                </div>
                <h3>MYOwnLife</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>At HackPSU (Pennsylvania State University), my team and I created MYOwnLife which is a project that uses a MYO armband and a seizure detection algorithm to help people that are suffering from epilepsy. We take in the input from the MYO armband, process it and if we detect anything short of normal, we activate a "risk event" on a supplementary app that we wrote. If the event is activated, the app will ask the user if everything is okay, and if the user does not respond within 5 seconds, we call a predetermined number. The user also has the option to immediately call 911. We won the IEEE prize for this project. I worked on the app and the detection algorithm. Languages &amp; frameworks: <b>Java, C, Python, MySQL, PHP, Android, MYO</b></p>
                </div>
                <h3>UFC Predictor</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>This is a personal project that started off orginially proposed as a business idea by Olsjon Baxhija. I wrote a python script that retreives match predictions from the betting companies and runs a fairly simple analysis on past matches, predicting the winner and subsequently whether you should bet or not. The predictions passed testing on an extended data set and yielded very favorable returns. Olsjon and I have agreed to open source this project soon. <b>Python</b></p>
                </div>
                <h3>Langmatch</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>One of the most interesting hackathon projects I would say is Langmatch at BostonHacks (Boston University). My team and I created an android app that lets you match images with words in different languages. We also wrote a synonymous application for Windows. I worked on the windows application. Languages &amp; frameworks: Java, Android, C#, .NET</p>
